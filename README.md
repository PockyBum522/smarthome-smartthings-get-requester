Modified Button Controller
 
Modified by David so a HTTP get is sent when buttons are pressed instead of controlling lighting.
 
smartthings_LAN_get_requester_button_controller Allows a smartthings button device, such as the Aeon minimote to 
make GET requests to LAN devices that are on the same network as the hub.

Note: The app treats the Aeon Minimote buttons as 1,2,3,4 for a single press and
5,6,7,8 when the buttons are pressed and held. This should be pretty self explanatory but
holding 1 is equivalent to button 5, holding 2 is equivalent to button 6, and so on.
